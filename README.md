# Team Profile Generator

## About

This CLI application will quickly generate a software engineering team webpage for distribution among employees for reference. The user will follow a series of prompts providing information the following information: 

1. Manager's name, employee ID number, email, and office number.
2. For each employee on that team, their role, name, employee ID number, email, and either their GitHub username if they are an engineer or their school if they are an intern.

The application will then generate the HTML and write it to a file.
